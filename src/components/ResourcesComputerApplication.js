              This course is aimed at people interested in UI/UX Design. Weâ€™ll
              start from the very beginning and work all the way through, step
              by step. If you already have some UI/UX Design experience but
              want to get up to speed using Adobe XD then this course is perfect
              for you too!

              First, we will go over the differences between UX and UI Design.
              We will look at what our brief for this real-world project is,
              then we will learn about low-fidelity wireframes and how to make
              use of existing UI design kits.
